One Sided Tests for One Sample

Complete one_sided_tests() below. Each file holds one sample of numbers (one per line). The function runs a
one-sided t-test on every file and returns the names of the files where the null hypothesis is rejected.

Your function is tested on different random files than the ones in the self-check at the bottom of this
file, so it must use every parameter: the list of files, the hypothesized mean, alpha and the side of the test.

Submit this file to Gradescope.
