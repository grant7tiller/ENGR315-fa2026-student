Pandas Tensile Summary

The tensile data from the previous module was written to a single CSV file with one row per
sample and these columns:

    Sample_Name, Material_Type, Tensile_Strength, Fracture_Strain, Elastic_Modulus, Yield_Strength

Complete the six functions below using Pandas. Each function is graded separately, so you can
work on them in any order. Your functions will be tested on tensile files with different
materials, a different number of samples, and rows in a different order than the course file,
so do not write code that only works for 1045CR, 2024 and PMMA.

Submit this file to Gradescope.
