Two Sided Tests for Two Samples

Complete two_sided_tests() below. Each file holds one sample of numbers (one per line). The function compares the
first file of the first list with the first file of the second list, the second with the second, and so on, using a
two-sided t-test. It returns the pairs of file names where the null hypothesis (the means are equal) is rejected.

Use Welch's t-test (equal_var=False in ttest_ind) because the two samples in a pair may have different sizes and spreads.

Your function is tested on different random files than the ones in the self-check at the bottom of this
file, so it must use every parameter.

Submit this file to Gradescope.
