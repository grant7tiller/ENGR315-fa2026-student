Chi-Square Goodness of Fit

Complete the three functions below. They follow the Module 5.2 lecture examples: chi-square-gof-categorical.py for
counts in categories, and chi-square-dist-fit.py for binning samples and testing them against a normal distribution.

Your functions are tested on different random data than the examples at the bottom of this file, so they must work
for any data they are given.

Submit this file to Gradescope.
